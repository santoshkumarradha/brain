    "Your role is to engage in meta-learning to master the process of analytical reasoning for solving complex scientific tasks. Your objective is not to memorize specific facts or solutions, but to develop a robust skill set for systematic thinking, logical inference, and adaptive problem-solving. A critical part of this process is identifying and learning from mistakes, not just specific errors but generalizable patterns of reasoning missteps and strategies for improvement. The core of your approach should focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learning Analytical Reasoning**:\n",
    "   Study the provided examples of scientific reasoning, including questions, reasoning processes, and solutions, to internalize the principles of logical analysis, structured problem-solving, and evidence-based decision-making. Identify common reasoning steps that lead to success or failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identifying Patterns and Strategies**:\n",
    "   Recognize recurring patterns in logical structures, reasoning techniques, and scientific principles. Similarly, identify generalizable reasoning errors or flaws. Generalize strategies to address new and unseen questions while avoiding repeated mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Meta-Cognition**:\n",
    "   Reflect on your reasoning processes to understand how effective solutions are constructed and identify areas where reasoning strategies fail or lead to suboptimal outcomes. Develop insights into how to refine these strategies for flexible adaptation across diverse scientific domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Building a Reasoning Skill Set**:\n",
    "   Practice adaptive reasoning by applying learned patterns and strategies to new problems. Analyze tasks for unique features, avoiding reliance on memorized answers or specific facts. Note down general mistakes, such as over-reliance on assumptions, logical fallacies, or missed contextual clues, and integrate strategies to prevent them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Learning from Mistakes**:\n",
    "   Continuously refine your reasoning by comparing your thought processes and solutions to provided answers. Explicitly document reasoning errors in a general format, such as flawed assumptions, incorrect prioritization of information, or overgeneralization. Use these insights to improve your problem-solving framework for future tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Focusing on Principles and Errors Over Facts**:\n",
    "   Prioritize understanding and applying underlying scientific principles and logical methods over memorizing domain-specific details. At the same time, focus on avoiding generalized reasoning errors by learning from past mistakes. Ensure your answers are grounded in analytical thinking and sound reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: Do not memorize the specific answers or facts. Instead, focus on identifying general reasoning mistakes, noting these errors, and updating your approach to avoid them. Build a repository of effective reasoning strategies and error-prevention techniques.\n",

However, the output could benefit from greater specificity in the feedback and the inclusion of additional strategies and mappings relevant to analytical reasoning. Here’s a breakdown by focus area:\\n\\n1. **Strengthen Pattern Recognition Techniques**: The existing knowledge focuses on standard errors and logical fallacies but lacks a system for recognizing effective reasoning patterns in various scientific contexts. Adding knowledge about how to apply these recognized patterns would enhance the analytical capability.\\n\\n2. **Improve Meta-Cognitive Analysis**: While the existing items focus on reflecting on errors, they do not extensively cover how to systematically integrate successful strategies into future reasoning. Developing a framework for synthesizing successful strategies into a meta-cognitive approach would be beneficial.\\n\\n3. **Emphasize Adaptive Questioning Skills**: There is a need for a more structured approach to asking adaptive questions that would help in exploring the nuances of complex problems, rather than just ensuring clarity and aiding creativity. Introducing a toolkit or a specific set of questioning strategies could enhance flexibility in reasoning.\\n\\n4. **Refine Error Identification Processes**: The existing error-checklist is a great start. However, it could be expanded to include contextualizing errors relative to specific scientific domains (e.g., physics, biology) to enhance its utility. This would allow users to apply systematic error-checking in a more tailored way depending on the discipline.\\n\\n5. **Focus on Principle Understanding Over Memorization**: Stressing principles is good, but strategies for effectively teaching or internalizing these principles is lacking. Ideas about how to create conscious connections between principles and their practical applications could enhance understanding.\\n\\n6. **Enhance Generalization of Strategies**: Addressing how learned strategies can be systematically transferred across various scientific contexts would be instrumental.
