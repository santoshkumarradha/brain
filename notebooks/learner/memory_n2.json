      "content": "Create procedures for continuous feedback and adjustment of transformation methods based on success metrics related to semantic completeness and phonetic representation."
    },
    "69": {
      "content": "Institute mechanisms to bridge the gap between semantic integrity and phonetic transformation, ensuring outputs not only sound coherent but also convey the intended messages effectively."

    "72": {
      "content": "Develop a criterion to evaluate the phonetic relevance of both consonants and vowels in each input phrase, leading to the identification of essential elements that should be included in the output."
